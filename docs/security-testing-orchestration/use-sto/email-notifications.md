This topic describes an example workflow for generating email notifications. This topic describes two separate methods for generating email notifications:

* Add an Email notification step that sends emails based a JEXL filter -- for example: "Send am email if any issues with MEDIUM severity or higher are found." 
* Add an OPA policy step that sends a notification and fails the pipeline if any issues with HIGH or CRITICAL severity are found. 

These steps generate emails based on the output variables generated by a previous scan. 

## Generate notifications based on severity levels using JEXL

1. Add a CI build stage or a Security stage to your pipeline.
